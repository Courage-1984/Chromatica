# This is a placeholder for a numpy array file
# In practice, this would be a 1152-dimensional histogram (8x12x12 L*a*b* bins)
# For demonstration purposes, we'll create a text representation

# Blue-dominated histogram (8x12x12 L*a*b* bins)
# L* bins: 0-100 (8 bins)
# a* bins: -128 to +127 (12 bins) 
# b* bins: -128 to +127 (12 bins)

# Sample histogram data structure:
# - High values in blue regions (negative b* values)
# - Low values in red/yellow regions (positive b* values)
# - Balanced distribution across L* (lightness) values
# - Total sum = 1.0 (normalized histogram)

# This file would contain the actual numpy array when generated
# For now, it serves as a placeholder for the quick test dataset
