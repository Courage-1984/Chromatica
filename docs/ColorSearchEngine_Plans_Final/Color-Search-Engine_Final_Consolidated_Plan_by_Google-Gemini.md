# Color-Search-Engine_Consolidated_Plan.md

## A. Executive summary

This plan details a production-ready, two-stage color search engine that retrieves images whose dominant palettes best match a weighted, multi-color query. The core of our system is a sparse, normalized histogram representation built in the **CIE Lab color space**, chosen for its perceptual uniformity, which avoids the non-uniformity of RGB and the hue wraparound issues of HSV. Each image is converted into a fixed-length vector using a **8x12x12 binning grid (1,152 dimensions)**, with pixel values distributed to neighboring bins via **tri-linear soft assignment** to ensure robustness against minor color shifts. [decision]: recommended by {Google-Gemini, Qwen}

For efficient retrieval, we employ a two-stage process. First, a fast Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search is performed using a **FAISS HNSW index**. To make the histograms compatible with the index's L2 distance metric, we apply a **Hellinger transformation (element-wise square root)**. This stage retrieves a broad set of candidates (e.g., top 200). Second, these candidates are re-ranked using a high-fidelity, perceptually accurate metric: the **Sinkhorn-approximated Earth Mover's Distance (EMD)**. This principled approach correctly models the "work" required to transform one color palette into another, properly accounting for both color differences and their relative weights. Evaluation on the COCO and Unsplash Lite datasets will target a P95 total latency of under 450ms while achieving high relevance scores (Precision@10 \> 0.7).

## B. Deep research notes

The technical foundation for this plan is built upon the following key research and libraries:

  * **Swain & Ballard (1991)**: Introduced the foundational concept of using color histogram intersection for fast image indexing.
  * **Rubner et al. (2000)**: Established Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) as a superior, perceptually meaningful metric for image retrieval that correctly handles cross-bin color similarities.
  * **Cuturi (2013)**: Developed "Sinkhorn Distances," an entropy-regularized approximation of EMD that makes optimal transport computationally feasible for real-time systems, enabling our high-fidelity reranking stage.
  * **Johnson et al. (2017)**: Created the FAISS library, which provides state-of-the-art, efficient implementations of ANN algorithms like HNSW, forming the backbone of our initial candidate retrieval.
  * **Vedaldi & Zisserman (2011)**: Provided the theoretical basis for using explicit feature maps to transform histogram distances (like Hellinger) into a standard Euclidean space, making them compatible with ANN indexes.
  * **Perceptual Color Spaces (CIE)**: Decades of research from the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) produced the Lab color space, where numerical distance closely approximates human-perceived color difference, a critical property for our EMD cost matrix.

## C. System design

#### Architecture Diagram Summary

```
[Image Input] -> [Preprocessing Pipeline] -> [Histogram Generation] -> [ANN Index (FAISS HNSW)]
      ^                      ^
      |                      |
[Query Input] -> [Query Processor] -> [ANN Search] -> [Candidate Reranking] -> [Final Results]
```

#### Dataflow

1.  **Offline Indexing**:

      * **Ingest**: An image is ingested, downscaled to a max side of 256px.
      * **Color Conversion**: The image is converted from its original color space to sRGB, then to CIE Lab.
      * **Histogram Generation**: A 1,152-dimension normalized histogram is generated using tri-linear soft assignment.
      * **Indexing**: The histogram is Hellinger-transformed (element-wise square root) and indexed in a FAISS HNSW index. The raw histogram is stored separately for reranking.

2.  **Online Search**:

      * **Query**: The API receives hex colors and weights, which are converted into a "softened" query Lab histogram.
      * **Stage 1: ANN Search**: The query histogram is Hellinger-transformed and used to retrieve the top-200 candidate images from the FAISS index.
      * **Stage 2: Reranking**: The raw histograms for the 200 candidates are fetched. The Sinkhorn-EMD is computed between the query and each candidate.
      * **Results**: Candidates are re-sorted by their Sinkhorn distance and the final list is returned.

#### Storage Choices

  * **Vector Index**: **FAISS HNSW (`IndexHNSWFlat`)** is chosen for its excellent performance-to-accuracy ratio and lack of a training phase, making it ideal for this application. [decision]: recommended by {Google-Gemini}
  * **Metadata & Raw Histograms**: **DuckDB** or **SQLite** will be used to store image metadata (IDs, paths) and the original, non-transformed histograms required for the reranking stage. This provides fast key-value lookup for a batch of candidates. [decision]: recommended by {Google-Gemini, Qwen}

-----

## D. Algorithm specification

#### Color Quantization & Binning

  * **Color Space**: **CIE Lab (D65 illuminant)**. [decision]: recommended by {Google-Gemini, Qwen}
  * **Binning Grid**: A fixed 3D grid is used, with bin counts allocated to best represent the typical sRGB gamut coverage in Lab space. [decision]: INFERENCE (Synthesized from principled arguments in both plans)
      * **L\* (Lightness)**: **8 bins** over the range `[0, 100]`
      * **a\* (Green-Red)**: **12 bins** over the range `[-86, 98]`
      * **b\* (Blue-Yellow)**: **12 bins** over the range `[-108, 95]`
      * **Total Dimensions**: $8 \\times 12 \\times 12 = 1,152$

#### Histogram & Soft-Assignment Pipeline

For each pixel with a Lab coordinate $(l, a, b)$, we distribute its count to the 8 nearest bin centers using tri-linear interpolation. This prevents hard quantization boundaries and makes the representation more robust. After all pixels are processed, the histogram $h$ is normalized such that $\\sum h\_i = 1$. [decision]: recommended by {Google-Gemini, Qwen}

#### Candidate Embedding for ANN

To use an L2-based ANN index, we map the normalized histogram $h$ to a new vector $\\phi(h)$ using the Hellinger transform. The squared Euclidean distance between two transformed vectors is proportional to the Hellinger distance, a true probability metric, making it an excellent proxy for histogram similarity. [decision]: recommended by {Google-Gemini, Qwen}
$$\phi(h) = \sqrt{h} = [\sqrt{h_1}, \sqrt{h_2}, \dots, \sqrt{h_{1152}}]$$

#### Final High-Fidelity Distance (Sinkhorn-EMD)

For high-fidelity reranking, we compute the entropy-regularized Earth Mover's Distance between the query histogram $h\_q$ and a candidate histogram $h\_c$. This is solved efficiently using the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm. [decision]: recommended by {Google-Gemini, Qwen}
$$W_{\epsilon}(h_q, h_c) = \min_{P \in U(h_q, h_c)} \langle P, M \rangle - \epsilon H(P)$$
Where:

  * $M$ is the **cost matrix**, where $M\_{ij} = |c\_i - c\_j|\_2^2$ is the squared Euclidean distance between the Lab coordinates of bin centers $c\_i$ and $c\_j$. This matrix is pre-computed.
  * $P$ is the optimal transport plan between the two histograms.
  * $\\epsilon \> 0$ is the regularization strength (e.g., $\\epsilon=0.1$).

-----

## E. Implementation plan

#### Checklist & Timeline

## F. Evaluation plan

#### Datasets

  * **Primary**: **Unsplash Lite** (25k images). Its curated nature provides high-quality images with diverse and distinct color palettes, ideal for this task. [decision]: recommended by {Qwen}
  * **Secondary**: **COCO 2017 validation subset** (5k images). This provides a test for generalization on a wider variety of "in-the-wild" scenes. [decision]: recommended by {Google-Gemini}

#### Metrics

| Metric       | Target | Measurement Method                                                |
| :----------- | :----- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Precision@10 | \>0.7   | Human-labeled relevance (relevant/not relevant) for 100 test queries. |
| nDCG@50      | \>0.6   | Ranked relevance using a 3-level judgment (highly/somewhat/not relevant). |
| mAP          | \>0.65  | Mean Average Precision across all test queries.                   |
| Latency P95  | \<450ms | End-to-end server response time under production-like load.       |

#### Ablation Plan

To validate our design choices, we will systematically compare:

1.  **Color Space**: CIE Lab (proposed) vs. baseline RGB histogram.
2.  **Assignment**: Tri-linear soft assignment (proposed) vs. hard assignment (one pixel to one bin).
3.  **ANN Proxy**: Hellinger proxy (proposed) vs. raw L2 distance on histograms.
4.  **Reranking**: Two-stage Sinkhorn rerank (proposed) vs. returning raw ANN results directly.

#### Sanity Checks & Test Cases

  * **Monochrome**: A query for 100% `#FF0000` should return images dominated by red.
  * **Complementary**: A query for 50% `#0000FF` (blue) and 50% `#FFA500` (orange) should return images featuring that contrast.
  * **Weight Sensitivity**: `90% red, 10% blue` should yield different, more red-dominant results than `10% red, 90% blue`.
  * **Subtle Hues**: A query for two very similar colors (e.g., `#FF0000` and `#EE0000`) should test the system's fine-grained perception.

-----

## G. Performance & scaling

#### Memory and Index Size

  * **Raw Histograms (for reranking)**: $N\_{\\text{images}} \\times D\_{\\text{bins}} \\times 4 \\text{ bytes}$
  * **FAISS HNSW Index**: HNSW has a memory overhead of roughly 1.5-2x the size of the raw vectors it stores.
  * **Total RAM for 1M images**: $(1,000,000 \\times 1,152 \\times 4 \\text{ bytes}) + (1,000,000 \\times 1,152 \\times 4 \\text{ bytes} \\times 1.75) \\approx \\mathbf{12.7 \\text{ GB}}$

| N (images) | Raw Histograms (GB) | HNSW Index (GB) | Total Est. RAM (GB) |
| :--------- | :------------------ | :-------------- | :------------------ |
| 100k       | 0.46                | 0.81            | 1.3                 |
| 1M         | 4.6                 | 8.1             | 12.7                |
| 10M        | 46.0                | 80.5            | 126.5               |

#### Latency Targets (P95)

  * **ANN Search (Stage 1)**: \< 150 ms
  * **Reranking (Stage 2)**: \< 300 ms (for K=200 candidates)
  * **Total End-to-End Latency**: **\< 450 ms**

#### Recommended Rerank K

Start with **K=200**. This value represents a trade-off: it must be large enough to ensure the ANN stage has high recall (i.e., the best results are likely within this set) but small enough to keep reranking latency acceptable. [decision]: recommended by {Google-Gemini, Qwen}

-----

## H. UX & API

#### REST Endpoint

**Endpoint**: `GET /search`

**Query Parameters**:

}
```

## I. Risks & mitigations

1.  **Risk: Rerank Latency is Too High.**
      * **Mitigation**: Tune the Sinkhorn regularization parameter $\\epsilon$ (larger values converge faster). Limit the max K for reranking. If still a bottleneck, explore faster optimal transport approximations like Sliced Wasserstein Distance.
2.  **Risk: Memory Footprint at Large Scale (\>10M images).**
      * **Mitigation**: Switch the FAISS index from `IndexHNSWFlat` to `IndexIVFPQ`. This adds Product Quantization to compress the vectors, significantly reducing memory at a small cost to accuracy. Store raw histograms on a fast SSD instead of in RAM.
3.  **Risk: Background Dominance.**
      * **Mitigation**: A large, uniform background can overwhelm the histogram. Implement an optional "saliency weighting" mode that uses a simple algorithm (e.g., spectral residual saliency) to give more weight to foreground pixels during histogram creation.
4.  **Risk: Color Management of Non-sRGB Images.**
      * **Mitigation**: The Lab conversion assumes an sRGB input. Images with other embedded profiles (e.g., Adobe RGB) can cause inaccuracies. Standardize all inputs by converting them to sRGB during ingest, using a library that respects ICC profiles.
5.  **Risk: Poor ANN Recall.**
      * **Mitigation**: The ANN stage might fail to retrieve the best candidates, especially for sparse queries. Tune HNSW's `efSearch` parameter at query time to increase search breadth at a small latency cost. Increase the number of candidates (K) passed to the reranker.
6.  **Risk: Subjective Evaluation.**
      * **Mitigation**: Color similarity is subjective, making automated evaluation difficult. Rely on human-in-the-loop labeling for a core set of test queries to compute nDCG/mAP. Supplement with extensive qualitative analysis and the defined sanity checks.
