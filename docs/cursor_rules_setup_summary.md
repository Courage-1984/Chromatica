# Cursor Rules Setup Summary

## Overview

The Chromatica project has been successfully migrated to the new Cursor Rules system, providing better organization, improved functionality, and enhanced developer experience. This document provides a quick summary of the new setup.

## New Structure

### Project Rules (Recommended)

```
.cursor/rules/
â”œâ”€â”€ chromatica-project.mdc          # Core project rules (Always Applied)
â”œâ”€â”€ algorithmic-specifications.mdc  # Algorithm and implementation specs
â”œâ”€â”€ api-endpoints.mdc              # API endpoint specifications
â”œâ”€â”€ testing-validation.mdc         # Testing standards and validation
â”œâ”€â”€ development-workflow.mdc       # Development environment and workflow
â”œâ”€â”€ documentation-standards.mdc    # Documentation requirements
â”œâ”€â”€ indexing-module.mdc           # FAISS and DuckDB implementation
â”œâ”€â”€ tools-module.mdc              # Tools and utilities
â”œâ”€â”€ web-interface.mdc             # Web interface and visualization tools
â””â”€â”€ legacy-migration.mdc          # Migration notes and legacy support
```

### AGENTS.md Alternative

A simple markdown file (`AGENTS.md`) provides an alternative approach for teams that prefer a single-file solution.

## Key Features

### Rule Types

1. **Always Applied**: Core project rules that always apply
2. **Auto-Attached**: Rules that apply based on file patterns
3. **Manual**: Rules available for AI to include when relevant

### Benefits

- **Modular Organization**: Rules organized by topic and scope
- **Better Scoping**: Rules apply only when relevant
- **Easier Maintenance**: Individual rule files are easier to update
- **Enhanced Functionality**: Rich metadata and flexible application

## Usage

### For Developers

- **Use Project Rules**: For comprehensive control and organization
- **Use AGENTS.md**: For simple, single-file approach
- **Don't Mix**: Avoid using both systems simultaneously

### For AI Assistants

- **Check Rule Type**: Understand rule application context
- **Respect Scoping**: Apply rules only when relevant
- **Follow Metadata**: Use rule metadata for proper application

## Migration Status

### âœ… Completed

- [x] Created new `.cursor/rules/` directory structure
- [x] Migrated all rules to MDC format with proper metadata
- [x] Created AGENTS.md alternative
- [x] Updated `.cursorignore` file
- [x] Created comprehensive documentation

### ðŸ”„ Current Status

- **Project Rules**: Fully implemented and operational
- **AGENTS.md**: Available as alternative approach
- **Legacy Support**: `.cursorrules` preserved for reference
- **Documentation**: Complete migration guide available

## Quick Start

### Using Project Rules

1. Rules are automatically applied based on file patterns
2. Core rules always apply to the entire project
3. Specialized rules apply when working with specific file types
4. AI can manually include additional rules when relevant

### Using AGENTS.md

1. Place `AGENTS.md` in project root
2. Contains all essential project information
3. Simple markdown format for easy reading
4. Alternative to structured Project Rules system

## Configuration

### Rule Metadata Example

```markdown
---
description: Core project rules and critical instructions compliance
globs: []
alwaysApply: true
---
```

### Auto-Attached Rule Example

```markdown
---
description: Algorithmic specifications and implementation requirements
globs: ["src/chromatica/core/**/*", "src/chromatica/indexing/**/*"]
alwaysApply: false
---
```

## Best Practices

1. **Logical Grouping**: Group related rules together
2. **Clear Naming**: Use descriptive names for rule files
3. **Appropriate Scoping**: Use globs to target relevant files
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep rules updated with project changes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Rules Not Applying**: Check glob patterns and metadata
- **Conflicting Rules**: Review and consolidate conflicting instructions
- **Performance Issues**: Optimize rule size and glob patterns

### Debugging Tips

1. Check active rules in Cursor's rule management interface
2. Test rule application with different file types
3. Monitor AI behavior to ensure rules are being followed
4. Update rules based on observed behavior

## Documentation

- **Migration Guide**: `docs/cursor_rules_migration_guide.md`
- **Setup Summary**: `docs/cursor_rules_setup_summary.md` (this document)
- **Critical Instructions**: `docs/.cursor/critical_instructions.md`
- **Project Rules**: `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` files
- **AGENTS.md**: Alternative markdown approach

## Next Steps

1. **Test the new system** with your development workflow
2. **Provide feedback** on rule effectiveness and clarity
3. **Update rules** as project requirements evolve
4. **Share best practices** with the development team

## Support

For questions or issues with the new Cursor Rules setup:

1. Check the migration guide for detailed information
2. Review the critical instructions for project-specific guidance
3. Test with different file types to understand rule application
4. Update rules based on your specific needs and workflow

The new Cursor Rules system provides a more organized, efficient, and maintainable approach to managing AI assistant behavior in the Chromatica project.
